	The Server architechture and computations have received an entire overhaul. This was done in efforts to create a
	server that reboots when an error occurs and is easily updated when updates need to be made. This change should 
	mainly affect connections to external apps by allowing attempts to be made again by the server before prompting an
	error to the user. This should prevent small errors from occuring and notify the user of larger ones.

09/15/2023
	An error was caught when importing material from a deleted sequence into an existing sequence that would cause the
	program to import it as a new material. This would generate a new label and delete the old label. This has been
	adjusted to account for all material regardless of what sequence is being imported. This will prioritize updating
	existing material over adding and deleting material. Also the importing screen now shows strictly what is being 
	altered within the job. This is to streamline the information being shown on the screen.

	In addition to this, Admin Portal received some changes. Mainly alterations to visuals being the Employee creation
	and the inspections on the employee screen. New features have been added to this widget, that being the new "Change
